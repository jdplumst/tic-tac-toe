This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project uses Factory Functions and the Module Pattern.

There are two game modes: singleplayer and multiplayer.

In singleplayer, the user plays against a simple AI. The AI works by selecting the first empty slot on the board from left to right, then top to bottom.

In multiplayer, the game alternates between player 1 and player 2 to make turns on the board.
